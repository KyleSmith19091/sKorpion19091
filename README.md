## Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
The name is Kyle and I have been inputting text into a computer so that it can do cool stuff since I was 12. I am currently a **computer science student** at the **University of Pretoria** in South Africa. Programming to me is a way of staying sane in a world which I find to be crazy and weird.
My programming experience comes from the five years of Robotics Programming for our High School team. I spend most of my time solving online
programming related problems and developing smaller programs ranging from bash commands to stock screeners.

```javascript
const Coder = {
 name : "Kyle",
 hobbies: ["Skateboarding", "Reading", "Gym", "Cycling", "Reading", "Puzzle Solving", "Youtube(watching)"],
 food: ["sushi", "pizza", "sandwich"],
 challenge: "Daily Dev: Try to learn something new related to computer science"
}
```
